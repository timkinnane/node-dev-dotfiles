# Dot Files

Version managed portable development environment configuration for JS/TS devs on OSX.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This repo contains no personal data or secrets, but some configs are specific to our org and
> developer tooling. For example, it has some opinionated usage of AWS SSO and cert bundles.
>
> All modules are linked in [.zshrc](../zsh/.zshrc) and can be disabled to choose which to apply.

## Setup

## Updating

#### Pulling Changes

To update your local dotfiles and get the benefit of any contributions since you setup your machine:
1. Go to the dotfiles path `cd $DOTFILES`
2. Make sure you have no uncommitted changes: `git status`
3. Ensure you're on the primary branch: `git checkout trunk`
4. Pull latest changes: `git pull`
6. Rerun installer to get new modules: `dotfiles-install`

#### Adding Home Configs

When installing a new tool that reads configuration from `$HOME`:
1. Create folder for configs: `mkdir $DOTFILES/config/my-new-tool`
2. Move any default configs: `mv $HOME/my-new-tool-config $DOTFILES/config/my-new-tool`
3. Stow to link back to home: `stow -v -t $HOME -d $DOTFILES/config -S my-new-tool`

#### Adding Shell Configs

When adding a new environment module (any custom shell configs, functions, alias etc):
1. Create (and edit) code: `touch $DOTFILES/environment/my-new-module.sh`
2. Start a new terminal session or run `zsh` to initialise in place

### Adding Brew Bundles

After adding a new package to `brewfile`, run `brew bundle install --file=$DOTFILES/brewfile`
